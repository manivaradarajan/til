# Brhadaranyaka 1.4.10

The text here is ""yo anyām devatām upāste...". This is also covered in Brahma Sutra 4.1.3 ("atmeti upagacchanti grāhayanti ca").

Sankara bhashya on the Upanishad is here: https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117939.html.

Upon reading this passage, and trying to find common ground between Sankara and Ramanuja, 
it bears paying close attention to Sankara's comments here. Worshipping a god as "something other than oneself"
means that "one serves the god like a debtor" and the god makes use of this individual to satisfy their own desire.

This is not at all the mood of the bhakta (the brahmopāsaka of Sribhashya), where worship is not done out of any
sense of obligation but out of but out of love and recognition of the inherent relationship of Ātman as the 
majestic being seated at the core of one's very being. We may find  Nammalvar's reason for worship here 
instructive (not as a means, but as a recognition of one's fundamental relationship.
